- 👋 Hi, I’m @kingmelonhead (John Hackstadt outside of GitHub)
- 👀 I’m interested in anything computer science, video games, disc golf, or food related!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various topics at the University of Missouri St. Louis
- 💞️ I’m looking for internships or entry level jobs to start at now/after graduation (winter 2021)
- 📫 How to reach me: My old "work" email. "jhackstadtphoto@gmail.com" or Discord @KingMelonHead#1017

*** I'm still a student at UMSL, a lot of the work on here will be projects in a finished / near finished state. That being said, do your own work! Feel free to use anything here as a resource but do not turn anything in as your own. Just remember, your teacher can find this github profile just as easily as you did. ***

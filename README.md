- 👋 Hi, I’m @kingmelonhead (John Hackstadt outside of GitHub)
- 👀 I’m interested in anything computer science, video games, or food related!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various topics at the University of Missouri St. Louis
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on really anything outside of my typical comfort zone. Reason being I would like experience with more softare/programming languages
- 📫 How to reach me: My old "work" email. "jhackstadtphoto@gmail.com". Quotes on "Work" because it was an email I had when I was wanting to pursue photography as a side 
- job. I wasn't bad. School just got busy and I didnt have the resources to get high quality lenses. Oh well. Still enjoy photography as a hobby!
